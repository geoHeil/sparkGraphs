# demonstrate use of spark-sql
mini project to show how hive sql can easily be executed on spark

use `sbt console`to interactively run queries

or `./sync.sh` to run assembly

or `sbt run` but make sure to set `$SBT_OPTS -Xmx8G -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled -Xss2M`
as spark will be launched inside sbt 

for development (in the sbt shell) `~reStart`

also `sbt test` is useful ;)
